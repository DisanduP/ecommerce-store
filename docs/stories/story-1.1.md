# Story 1.1: User Registration

Status: Completed

## Story

As a new customer,
I want to register an account,
so that I can save my preferences and track orders.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Registration form collects email, password, and basic profile information
2. Email verification process to confirm account ownership
3. Password strength validation and security requirements
4. Successful registration creates user account in database

## Dev Notes

- Backend: Node.js with Express, TypeScript, SQLite database
- Authentication: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Axios for API calls
- Follow architecture patterns: RESTful API, consistent error handling
- Database: SQLite with better-sqlite3 for file-based storage

### Project Structure Notes

- Backend structure: src/controllers/, src/models/, src/routes/
- Frontend structure: src/components/, src/pages/, src/services/
- API responses: { success: boolean, data?: any, error?: string }
