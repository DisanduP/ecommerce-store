### Expected vs Found

- **Expected for Level 2:** PRD, Architecture/Tech Spec, Epics/Stories
- **Found:** All required documents present
- **Missing:** None

## Document Analysis Summary

### PRD Analysis

- **Goals:** Clear business objectives (seamless shopping, secure payments, product search)
- **Requirements:** 6 functional requirements, 3 non-functional requirements
- **Scope:** Well-defined boundaries, explicit exclusions
- **Epics:** 3 logical delivery milestones identified

### Architecture Analysis

- **Technology Stack:** React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, SQLite database
- **Project Structure:** Clear separation of frontend/backend concerns
- **Implementation Patterns:** Comprehensive consistency rules defined
- **Deployment:** Azure App Service strategy documented

### Epic/Story Analysis

- **Coverage:** All PRD requirements mapped to stories
- **Stories:** 11 total stories across 3 epics
- **Dependencies:** Proper sequencing with no circular dependencies
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Detailed and testable criteria for each story

---

## Alignment Validation

### ✅ PRD ↔ Architecture Alignment

- All functional requirements have architectural support
- Non-functional requirements addressed (performance, security, compliance)
- Technology choices align with project constraints
- No architectural decisions contradict PRD requirements

### ✅ PRD ↔ Stories Coverage

- Every PRD requirement traces to implementing stories
- No orphaned stories without PRD backing
- Story acceptance criteria align with PRD success criteria
- Epic structure provides logical delivery sequence

### ✅ Architecture ↔ Stories Implementation

- Stories reflect architectural technology choices
- Technical tasks align with architectural patterns
- Infrastructure setup stories present for new components
- Implementation patterns will guide consistent coding

---

## Gap and Risk Analysis

### ✅ Critical Gaps

- **Status:** None identified
- All core requirements have implementation coverage
- No missing infrastructure or setup stories

### ✅ Sequencing Issues

- **Status:** None identified
- Story dependencies properly ordered
- No circular dependencies detected

### ✅ Contradictions

- **Status:** None identified
- All documents consistent and aligned
- No conflicting technical approaches

### ✅ Scope Issues

- **Status:** Well-controlled
- Architecture stays within PRD boundaries
- No gold-plating detected

---

## UX Validation

**UX Artifacts:** Not found (appropriate for Level 2 minimal UI focus)
**Assessment:** Basic UX principles documented in architecture
**Recommendation:** Sufficient for current scope

---

## Detailed Findings

### Strengths

- Complete document suite for Level 2 project
- Clear separation of concerns (frontend/backend)
- Comprehensive implementation patterns defined
- Well-structured story breakdown with dependencies
- Realistic scope for project level

### Minor Notes

- Could benefit from more detailed API specifications in future iterations
- Consider adding integration test stories for API endpoints

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ Proceed to Implementation

All validation criteria met. Ready to begin implementation phase.

### Next Steps

1. **Update workflow status** to Phase 4 - Implementation
2. **Run create-story workflow** for first story (story-1.1: User Registration)
3. **Follow story sequence** as defined in epics.md
4. **Use architecture.md** as implementation guide for all agents

### Implementation Order

- Epic 1: User Authentication (3 stories)
- Epic 2: Product Catalog (4 stories)
- Epic 3: Shopping Cart (4 stories)
